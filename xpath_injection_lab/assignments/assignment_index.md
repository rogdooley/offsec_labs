# Assignment Index

This document tracks all assignments completed as part of the `xpath_injection_lab` project under the `offsec_labs` repository. Each assignment builds on the previous one, guiding the development of a vulnerable web application and accompanying exploit scripts.

## XPath Injection Lab

### Assignment 0: Vulnerable XPath-Based Login App
- Description: Build a Flask app that performs unsafe XPath authentication using data from an XML file.
- Focus: Web application setup, session handling, unsafe XPath usage
- Status: Complete
- [View Assignment 0](assignment_00.md)

### Assignment 1: Blind XPath Injection to Extract Admin Usernames
- Description: Write a Python script that uses blind XPath injection to extract usernames of users with the role `admin`.
- Focus: Inference-based exploitation, XPath manipulation, automation
- Status: In Progress

## Coming Soon

Future assignments will expand into:

- Password exfiltration via XPath injection
- Privilege escalation by exploiting insecure role checks
- Login bypass using XPath short-circuit logic
- Automation and reporting improvements for the exploit script
- Converting the lab into a CTF-style challenge

Each assignment is standalone and can be reused or adapted for other web exploitation labs.
